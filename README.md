# Movie-App
Build a Movie App using Laravel, Tailwind CSS and The Movie DB REST API.

I go over the different architecture options and the different popular technologies around the Laravel/Vue community. 
We'll be making use of several Laravel 7 features like the HTTP Client and Blade Components.

We then style our application with the latest version of Tailwind CSS v3, using new features like CSS Grid and CSS Transitions.
